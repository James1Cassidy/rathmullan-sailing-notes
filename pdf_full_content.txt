“Joe Soap” Sheets
Version January 2016

--- PAGE 2 ---
Why use these “Joe Soap” sheets?
These “Joe Soap” Sheets are designed to help ISA Sailing Instructors to;
 Accurately track their sailors’ progress on the courses.
 Ensure that sailors have completed all of the syllabus
They can also help Senior Instructors and Centre Principals to;
 Track how instructors are progressing through the syllabus within the time allowed.
 Manage courses where sailors have more than one instructor or which are not being run
continuously.
 Ensure that instructors are covering all of the syllabus required
Tips on using these Sheets?
We recommend that you photocopy the sheets for the course that you are running from this
book. You can also print them off of the electronic version of this book which is available on the
ISA website.
Fill in your sailors names across the top of each of the pages of the course. The spaces
provided match the maximum number of sailors you are allowed to teach at that level.
Keep the sheets in a safe place ashore. This might be in the course folder with all the other
details relating to the course or on a notice board in an office or other place not accessible to
the general public.
As sailors demonstrate the skills or knowledge listed you can tick or otherwise mark them off on
the sheets. Simply ticking sailors off like this is sufficient; however some instructors do like to
employ more complicated systems which provide more information. An example is;
1 Use a circle to indicate that you have covered the skill or topic
2 Fill the circle in when the sailors has demonstrated the skill / knowledge to a
sufficient standard.
Numerical marking systems are not recommended as they tend to be overly complicated,
subjective and not particularly useful. (As an Instructor you need to judge are they good
enough or not rather that how good they are.)
Do remember that the order in which the skills and knowledge are listed on these sheets does
not indicate that this is the order in which they should be taught / covered. There should be a
course programme for each course being run. This will indicate the order in which skills are to
be covered and the time allowed. A template for a course programme is provided at the back of
this book.
The sailor’s logbook must be used to record each individual’s progress on the course. Every
sailor must have a logbook. These sheets must not be used and should be retained by the
Training Centre.
