            <h4 class="sub-section-heading">Hydration Strategy</h4>
            <p class="mb-4">Proper hydration is critical for maintaining focus, reaction times, and physical performance during racing:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-4">
                <li class="list-item"><strong>Before Sailing:</strong> Drink 500ml of water 2 hours before going afloat. Avoid excessive caffeine which can dehydrate you.</li>
                <li class="list-item"><strong>During Racing:</strong> Take small sips regularly (every 15-20 minutes) even if not thirsty. Keep a water bottle secured in the boat. In hot weather, consider electrolyte drinks to replace lost salts.</li>
                <li class="list-item"><strong>After Sailing:</strong> Rehydrate with water or sports drinks. A good indicator is urine color—pale yellow indicates good hydration.</li>
                <li class="list-item"><strong>Signs of Dehydration:</strong> Headache, dizziness, reduced concentration, dark urine, dry mouth. These severely impact racing performance.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="sub-section-heading">Fitness and Injury Prevention</h4>
            <p class="mb-4">Understanding how different aspects of fitness affect your sailing performance:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-4">
                <li class="list-item"><strong>Cardiovascular Fitness:</strong> Good aerobic fitness allows you to maintain concentration and quick reactions throughout a long race day. It helps you recover quickly between races and reduces fatigue-related errors.</li>
                <li class="list-item"><strong>Strength:</strong> Core and leg strength help maintain hiking position and boat balance. Upper body strength assists with sheet handling and boat control in heavy winds. Strong sailors can hold better body positions for longer.</li>
                <li class="list-item"><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Good flexibility, particularly in the lower back, hips, and shoulders, reduces injury risk during sudden movements (like quick tacks or capsize recovery) and allows more comfortable hiking positions.</li>
                <li class="list-item"><strong>Injury Prevention:</strong> Poor fitness increases risk of strains, sprains, and overuse injuries. Regular training builds resilience and reduces injury likelihood during demanding racing conditions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="sub-section-heading">Warm-Up and Cool-Down Routines</h4>
            <p class="mb-4">Every sailor should conduct proper warm-up and cool-down routines to prevent injury and improve performance:</p>

            <p class="mb-4">A fundamental part of racing is knowing the rules to avoid penalties and collisions, and understanding the signals used by the Race Committee.</p>

            <h4 class="sub-section-heading">Understanding Sailing Instructions</h4>
            <p class="mb-4">Before every race, you must be able to read and understand the Sailing Instructions (SIs). Here's how to interpret them:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-4">
                <li class="list-item"><strong>Race Schedule:</strong> Look for the date, time of first warning signal, and number of races scheduled. Note any time limits.</li>
                <li class="list-item"><strong>Course Description:</strong> Identify the course to be sailed (e.g., "Windward-Leeward twice" or "Triangular course"). Check the diagram showing mark locations and rounding order.</li>
                <li class="list-item"><strong>Starting Procedure:</strong> Confirm the starting sequence timing and any class-specific start times.</li>
                <li class="list-item"><strong>Marks:</strong> Note the description and color of marks to be rounded, and whether they should be left to port or starboard.</li>
                <li class="list-item"><strong>Finishing:</strong> Understand where the finish line is and which direction to cross it.</li>
                <li class="list-item"><strong>Special Rules:</strong> Look for any modifications to the Racing Rules of Sailing, restrictions on the sailing area, or required safety equipment.</li>
                <li class="list-item"><strong>Protests and Penalties:</strong> Understand the protest time limit and whether alternative penalties (like turns) are in effect.</li>
                <li class="list-item"><strong>Tip:</strong> Always read the SIs the night before and again before going afloat. Ask the race officer if anything is unclear.</li>

            <h4 class="sub-section-heading mt-8">Identifying Start Line Bias: Practical Methods & Quick Maths</h4>
            <p class="mb-4">Start line bias means one end of the line is closer to the wind (more upwind). Starting at the upwind end lets you <strong>sail a shorter distance</strong> and often protects your lane. Here are reliable ways to detect it quickly before the 1-minute signal.</p>

            <div class="ml-4 mb-6">
                <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Compass Method:</strong> Sail head-to-wind and note the wind bearing (e.g. 000°). Then point your bow exactly along the start line and read the line bearing (e.g. 085°). Subtract the wind direction. If the line bearing is rotated <em>to the left</em> (anticlockwise) of perpendicular, the pin end is favoured; if rotated to the right, the committee boat is favoured.</li>
                    <li><strong>Boom Angle (Head-to-Wind) Method:</strong> Stop at the middle of the line. Turn head-to-wind and sight which end looks more “ahead” of you toward the wind. The end closer to the wind is favoured.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transit / Sight Method:</strong> Line yourself up just below the line and sight through the pin to a background object (tree, building). Repeat from the committee boat end. If one end appears slightly more upwind (closer to perpendicular to wind), that’s the favoured end.</li>
                    <li><strong>Close-Hauled Test:</strong> Start near the middle; sheet in and sail close-hauled toward each end in turn. If you can sail <em>closer to the wind</em> toward one end without pinching, that end is favoured.</li>
                    <li><strong>Time & Distance Feel:</strong> While practising approaches, note whether sailing a straight close-hauled course from just below the line “reaches” one end earlier. Earlier = favoured.</li>
                    <li><strong>Quick Maths Advantage:</strong> Distance gained (metres) ≈ <code>Line Length × sin(bias angle)</code>. A 5° bias on a 150 m line gives ≈ 150 × sin(5°) ≈ 13 m (≈ 7 Laser lengths) advantage to the favoured end.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rule of Thumb:</strong> 1–2° = mild (choose for clear air), 3–5° = strong (fight for it early), >5° = dominant (plan approach specifically for that end).</li>
                    <li><strong>Dynamic Check:</strong> Re-check bias if the wind shifts after the 4-minute or 1-minute signals; a shift can flip favoured ends.</li>
                    <li><strong>Caution:</strong> Don’t sacrifice a <em>clean lane</em> for a tiny (1–2°) bias if it forces you into a congested, slow start.</li>

                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Account for Current:</strong> Sail in weaker current when beating against tide. This often means favoring the shoreline in tidal waters.</li>

                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Split if Behind:</strong> If behind, don't follow the leaders. Split from the fleet and gamble on a different side of the course to gain positions.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Wind Shifts:</strong> Continue to tack on headers and sail on lifts. Be aware if shifts are becoming more persistent or oscillating.</li>

                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Sail the Angles:</strong> Don't sail dead downwind. Sail by the lee or on a broad reach, gybing downwind in a series of angles (often faster VMG to the leeward mark).</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Seek Pressure:</strong> Head toward areas of more wind. Downwind speed is all about wind pressure.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Avoid Blankets:</strong> Stay out of wind shadows from boats ahead. Sail to the side if necessary to find clear air.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Favorable Current:</strong> On downwind legs, position yourself in the strongest favorable current. This is the opposite strategy to upwind legs.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Use Waves:</strong> In wave conditions, surf down waves by bearing away on the wave face and pumping the sail (within rule limits).</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Gybe on Lifts:</strong> Similar to tacking on headers upwind, gybe when the wind "lifts" you (allows you to head up) to stay on the favored gybe.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Leeward Mark Approach:</strong> Plan your approach to round the leeward mark smoothly. Arrive on starboard gybe if possible for right of way. Avoid overstanding the lay-line.</li>

                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Clear Air Priority:</strong> Get to windward of the fleet early to ensure clear, undisturbed wind. Windward position also lets you control boats to leeward.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Speed and Trim:</strong> Focus on boat speed through optimal sail trim and balance. Small adjustments make big differences on a reach.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Protect Inside at Mark:</strong> As you approach the reaching mark, position yourself for an inside overlap at the two-boat-length circle.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Watch for Lifts/Headers:</strong> Wind shifts affect reaching legs too. Adjust your angle to take advantage of favorable shifts.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Traffic Management:</strong> Avoid getting boxed in to leeward or trapped behind slower boats. Use your rights under the rules but sail conservatively to avoid penalties.</li>

                    <li class="list-item"><strong>What is Finish Line Bias?:</strong> Like the start line, one end of the finish line may be closer to the final mark, making it "favored."</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Identifying Bias (Theory):</strong> Stand at one end and sight along the line. The end that is further upwind on a windward finish (or further downwind on a leeward finish) is favored.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Practical Challenge:</strong> At the Start Racing level, identifying bias while racing is difficult. Focus on crossing the line at the end closest to your current position.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Final Approach Strategy:</strong> If finishing upwind, approach on starboard tack when possible. If finishing downwind, approach on starboard gybe.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Don't Overshoot:</strong> Cross the line as soon as you can. Don't sail past the favored end—you'll sail extra distance.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Clear Air to Finish:</strong> Ensure you have clear air in the final approach. Getting blanketed just before the finish can cost you positions.</li>

                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Crew Coordination:</strong> Crew should move smoothly across the boat, helping maintain balance without jerky movements that slow you down.</li>

                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Before the Tack:</strong> Build speed by sailing low for 2-3 seconds. Check behind and to leeward for clear space.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Initiate Smoothly:</strong> Push the tiller steadily (not violently) while keeping the boat flat. Call "Ready about... lee-ho!"</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Through the Tack:</strong> Helm moves across early while boat is head-to-wind. Crew releases jib at last moment when it starts to back, crosses quickly but smoothly.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Sheet In Fast:</strong> Pull both jib and main in quickly on the new tack. Delay = lost boat speed.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Minimize Rudder:</strong> Once through the wind, straighten the tiller quickly. Excessive rudder acts as a brake.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Accelerate:</strong> Bear away slightly (sail "low and fast") for 2-3 seconds after completing the tack to rebuild speed before heading up to close-hauled.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Common Mistakes:</strong> Tacking too slowly (boat loses speed), over-steering (too much rudder), or not sheeting in fast enough on the new tack.</li>

                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Preparation:</strong> Build speed before the gybe. Check behind for boats. Call "Ready to gybe... gybe-ho!"</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Initiate Turn:</strong> Bear away smoothly. As the boat turns dead downwind, pull the mainsheet in quickly (but controlled) to bring the boom across.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Cross the Boom:</strong> In light winds, physically pull the boom across. In stronger winds, sheet in most of the way and let it flip across with minimal force.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Control the Boom:</strong> As the boom crosses centerline, ease the mainsheet out quickly but in a controlled manner to prevent the boom slamming across.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Crew Movement:</strong> Crew should cross the boat smoothly, helping to keep it balanced. Avoid sudden weight shifts.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Exit the Gybe:</strong> Once on the new gybe, head up slightly to optimal downwind angle and adjust sail trim.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Safety:</strong> Keep your head low during the gybe to avoid being hit by the boom. Maintain balance throughout.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Common Mistakes:</strong> Letting the boom crash across (loses control and speed), turning too sharply (can cause capsize), or poor weight distribution.</li>

                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>What is a Lay-line?:</strong> The lay-line is the furthest line you can sail on one tack and still fetch (reach) the windward mark without tacking again.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Why Important?:</strong> Sailing past the lay-line means you sail extra distance. Tacking too early means another tack is needed.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Visual Method:</strong> Look at the mark and imagine a line extending from it at your boat's close-hauled angle (roughly 45° from the wind). You're on the lay-line when the mark is at this angle relative to your course.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Practical Test:</strong> When approaching the mark, head up to close-hauled. If the mark is directly ahead or slightly to leeward, you're on or past the lay-line. If it's to windward, you need to sail further before tacking.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Using Other Boats:</strong> Watch boats ahead on the same tack. If they tack and easily fetch the mark, you're near the lay-line.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Account for:</strong> Current/tide (may push you sideways), wind shifts (can lift or head you), and boat leeway (sideways slip).</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Strategy:</strong> Avoid overstanding (sailing past the lay-line). Tack just inside the lay-line to arrive at the mark on starboard tack with right of way.</li>

                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Speed Difference:</strong> To overtake, you must sail faster than the boat ahead. This requires better boat handling, sail trim, or tactical positioning.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Sail High and Fast:</strong> If you're faster, sail higher (closer to the wind) than the boat ahead. This gives you clear air and a better angle.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Overtake to Windward:</strong> Pass to windward when possible. This gives you the tactical advantage and cleaner air. Once ahead, you can bear down and control their wind.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Avoid Their Wind Shadow:</strong> If overtaking to leeward, ensure you get far enough ahead quickly to avoid their wind shadow blanking your sails.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Use Waves:</strong> Skilled sailors can surf waves to gain extra speed bursts on reaching legs. Pump the sails (within rules) and use body movement to catch waves.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Optimal Sailing Angle:</strong> Experiment with sailing angle. Sometimes sailing slightly higher maintains better speed and VMG (Velocity Made Good) toward the mark.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Right of Way:</strong> Remember - windward boat keeps clear. If overtaking to windward, you must stay clear. If overtaking to leeward and establishing an overlap from behind, announce "water!" if approaching a mark within two boat lengths.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Strategic Patience:</strong> Don't force a risky overtake. Wait for an opportunity when you have clear speed advantage or the boat ahead makes a mistake.</li>

            <h4 class="sub-section-heading">Classes of Boats Commonly Sailed in Ireland</h4>
            <p class="mb-4">Understanding different boat classes and their characteristics helps you appreciate the sailing community and potentially explore different types of racing:</p>

            <div class="ml-4 mb-4">
                <p class="font-bold mb-2">Single-Handed Dinghies:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Laser/ILCA:</strong> Single-handed, single sail dinghy. Three rig sizes (4.7, Radial, Standard). Simple, responsive, and popular for youth and adult racing. Excellent for developing boat handling skills.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Topper:</strong> Lightweight single-hander, ideal for younger or lighter sailors. Features a single sail and is known for being user-friendly and fun.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>RS Aero:</strong> Modern single-hander with three rig options. Lighter and faster than Laser, becoming increasingly popular in Ireland.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="ml-4 mb-4">
                <p class="font-bold mb-2">Double-Handed Dinghies:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>420:</strong> Two-person dinghy with mainsail, jib, and spinnaker. Popular training boat for developing crew work and advanced boat handling. Used extensively in youth racing.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Mirror:</strong> Traditional, stable two-person dinghy with main and jib. Great for learning and family sailing. Simple rigging makes it accessible for beginners.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>GP14 (General Purpose 14):</strong> Versatile two-person dinghy, very popular in Irish club racing. Main and jib configuration, stable and forgiving.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>RS200:</strong> Modern, fast two-person dinghy with asymmetric spinnaker. Excellent for developing racing skills and crew coordination.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Fireball:</strong> High-performance two-person dinghy requiring skill and athleticism. Main, jib, and spinnaker. Popular in competitive racing circuits.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="ml-4 mb-4">
                <p class="font-bold mb-2">Catamarans (Multihulls):</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Key Differences:</strong> Two hulls instead of one. Much faster than monohulls due to reduced drag. Wider beam provides stability but requires different balance techniques.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Handling:</strong> No heeling—catamarans stay level or lift one hull ("flying a hull"). Weight placement is critical. Capsizing results in a turnover (boat inverted) rather than a simple side capsize.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Common Classes:</strong> Hobie 16 (recreational and racing), Formula 18 (high-performance racing), Dart 18, Nacra 15/17.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Rigging Differences:</strong> Often use fully battened mainsails, rotating masts, and trapezes for both helm and crew in racing configurations.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="ml-4 mb-4">
                <p class="font-bold mb-2">Keelboats and Cruiser-Racers:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Key Differences:</strong> Fixed keel instead of centreboard, making them self-righting and more stable. Heavier and generally larger than dinghies.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Handling:</strong> Slower to respond to helm and sail adjustments. More momentum means better planning for manoeuvres. Often raced with larger crews (4-8 people).</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Common Classes in Ireland:</strong> Squib (one-design keelboat), J24, Sigma 33, SB20 (modern sportsboat), and various IRC/ECHO-rated cruiser-racers.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Rigging Differences:</strong> More complex sail inventory (multiple jibs, spinnakers, often genoas). More controls and adjustments (backstay, checkstays, cunningham, etc.).</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="ml-4 mb-4">
                <p class="font-bold mb-2">Understanding Class-Specific Features:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>One-Design Classes:</strong> All boats in the class are identical (e.g., Laser, 420, Fireball). Racing emphasizes sailor skill rather than equipment differences.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Handicap Racing:</strong> Different boat types race together using handicap systems (e.g., Portsmouth Yardstick, IRC, ECHO) to level performance differences.</li>
                    <li class="list-item"><strong>Local Variations:</strong> Check with your local sailing club to learn which classes are most popular in your area and which have active racing fleets.</li>
