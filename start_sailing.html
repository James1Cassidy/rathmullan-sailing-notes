                    <p class="mb-2"><strong>When to use it:</strong> Cam cleats are commonly used for securing sheets (ropes that control sails) like the jib sheet and main sheet. They use a spring-loaded cam mechanism to grip the rope, allowing for quick adjustment and release.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-item"><strong>Can secure a rope using a Horned cleat:</strong> (as on marinas)
                    <p class="mb-2">You'll usually see these on <strong>marinas</strong> (docks where boats are tied up) or on bigger boats. They're used for tying up your boat securely when you're finished sailing. You'll learn the proper figure-eight pattern to secure a line to a horned cleat.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-item"><strong>Can secure a rope using a Jam cleat:</strong> (often used on tiller to hold down rudder)
                    <p class="mb-2">Often used on the <strong>tiller</strong> (the stick you steer with) to hold down the rudder. This can keep the rudder in a fixed position, which is handy sometimes. Jam cleats use a simple V-shaped slot to pinch the rope.</p>

            <h3 class="section-heading">Launch & Recovery: Getting In & Out of the Water!</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">You'll learn how to safely push and pull your boat on its <strong>trolley</strong> around the boat park, making sure you don't bump into other boats or people and watch out for overhead wires. When lifting heavier parts like the mast or even the boat itself with help, you'll learn how to work with others to lift safely. You'll be taught to always look up and be aware of any overhead wires or cables when moving your boat, as they can be dangerous. With guidance, you'll practice pushing your boat into the water from the shore or a ramp, thinking about the wind direction and how deep the water is so your rudder and daggerboard don't hit the bottom. After launching, you'll learn the best place to park your boat's trolley so it's out of the way and safe. Finally, you'll practice sailing back to your starting point and carefully guiding your boat back onto its trolley, again considering the wind to make it easy.</p>

            <h3 class="section-heading">Sailing Techniques & Manoeuvres</h3>
            <h4 class="sub-section-heading">Basic Boat Handling</h4>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-4">
                <li class="list-item"><strong>Paddling/Rowing:</strong> You'll learn to <strong>paddle or row your boat in a straight line</strong> by focusing on symmetrical strokes on both sides, keeping your gaze fixed on a distant point ahead to maintain your bearing. This is a crucial emergency skill if your sail becomes unusable (e.g., it rips) and you need to get back to shore or a safe location.</li>
                <li class="list-item"><strong>Helm and Crew Roles:</strong> If you're in a two-person boat, it's <strong>vital</strong> that you spend <strong>equal amounts of time as both helm and crew</strong>. This is achieved by regularly switching positions during practice sessions. As helm, you'll gain a feel for steering and sail trim. As crew, you'll learn sail handling, observation, and effective communication, ensuring a well-rounded and collaborative learning experience.</li>
                <li class="list-item"><strong>Stopping the Boat (In Irons):</strong> You'll practice how to <strong>stop the boat precisely at a chosen spot on the water</strong> using the "in irons" technique. This involves slowly turning the bow of the boat directly into the wind. As the boat points into the wind, the sails will luff (flap) and lose power, bringing the boat to a gradual stop. You'll learn to anticipate the boat's momentum and timing to halt exactly where desired.</li>
                <li class="list-item"><strong>Getting Out of Irons and Getting Underway:</strong> You'll also learn to effectively <strong>get the boat out of irons</strong> and <strong>get underway again</strong> by sheeting in the sail and bearing away (turning the boat away from the wind). From the "in irons" position, you'll gently push the tiller to turn the bow slightly off the wind. Simultaneously, you'll trim (sheet in) the mainsheet to catch the wind, allowing the boat to gain momentum and begin sailing again.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="sub-section-heading">Steering and Course Control</h4>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-4">
                <li class="list-item"><strong>Reaching (Across the Wind):</strong> You'll practice sailing fast <strong>across the wind</strong> (known as a <strong>beam reach</strong>), focusing on <strong>controlling your speed and avoiding obstacles</strong>. To achieve this, you'll trim your sail so it's full and pulling, but not so tight that it wrinkles near the mast (which indicates "stalling" and loss of power). You'll use the rudder for precise steering to navigate around markers or other boats, observing the wind's effect on your direction and adjusting your course accordingly.</li>
                <li class="list-item"><strong>Close-Hauled Sailing:</strong> You'll learn to sail as <strong>close to the wind as possible without the sails flapping</strong> (called <strong>close-hauled</strong>). This technique is how you make progress against the wind by zig-zagging. While doing so, you'll aim to:
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mt-2">
                        <li class="list-item"><strong>Steer a reasonably constant course:</strong> This is achieved by making small, precise adjustments to the tiller while constantly observing the wind direction and the telltales on your sail. The goal is to keep the boat's bow pointed as high into the wind as possible without the sails luffing.</li>
                        <li class="list-item"><strong>Avoid unintended tacks:</strong> This requires constant attention to your course and wind direction. If the boat turns too far into the wind, it will "luff up" and potentially tack unintentionally. You'll learn to make immediate, corrective tiller movements to prevent this.</li>
                        <li class="list-item"><strong>Maintain proper sheeting positions:</strong> The sails should be trimmed in tightly but not over-trimmed. You'll learn to use the telltales as visual guides – they should be streaming smoothly aft, indicating optimal airflow over the sail.</li>
                        <li class="list-item"><strong>Keep the boat balanced:</strong> This involves using your body weight (hiking out) to counteract the force of the wind on the sails, keeping the boat flat and preventing excessive heeling (leaning).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            </div>

            <p class="mb-4"><strong>Running (Downwind):</strong> When sailing with the wind directly behind you, known as running, you'll learn to keep the sail out wide to catch all the wind. You'll also practice sailing downwind on a <strong>training run</strong> (a broad reach but not a dead run), focusing on:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mt-2">
                <li class="list-item"><strong>Steering a reasonably constant course:</strong> This can be challenging downwind as the boat can be less responsive. You'll use subtle tiller movements and observe your wake to ensure you're holding a steady line.</li>
                        <li class="list-item"><strong>Avoiding unintended gybes:</strong> An uncontrolled gybe can be dangerous. You'll learn to anticipate wind shifts and make small course corrections to keep the wind on the desired side of the boat, preventing the boom from swinging across unexpectedly.</li>
                        <li class="list-item"><strong>Maintain correct sail setting:</strong> The sail will be let out almost perpendicular to the boat, maximizing its exposure to the wind. You'll observe its shape and adjust for optimal drive.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/image10.png" alt="Points of Sailing Diagram for Running">
            </div>

            <p class="mb-4"><strong>Wind and Current Awareness:</strong> You'll begin to understand <strong>how the wind and any water currents affect your boat's movement</strong>, and <strong>how to use them to your advantage when steering to avoid obstacles</strong>. This involves observing ripples on the water, flags, and other boats to gauge wind shifts and currents. You'll then adjust your course and sail trim proactively to leverage these forces for efficient and safe navigation around markers or other vessels.</p>

            <h4 class="sub-section-heading">Turning Manoeuvres</h4>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-4">
                <li class="list-item"><strong>Tacking (Through the Wind):</strong> Your <strong>tacks</strong> (turning through the wind) will become smoother! You'll practice the sequence of turning the boat, moving your body across, and adjusting the sail in one fluid motion, coordinating with your crew. To achieve a smooth tack, you'll:
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mt-2">
                        <li class="list-item"><strong>Maintain boat speed through the manoeuvre:</strong> You'll initiate the turn with good speed and release the mainsheet just enough for the sail to pass through the wind, then re-trim quickly on the new tack to maintain momentum.</li>
                        <li class="list-item"><strong>Maintain an awareness of and avoiding other water users:</strong> Before initiating a tack, you'll perform a 360-degree scan to ensure the path is clear and communicate your intentions clearly to your crew and any nearby boats (e.g., "Ready to tack!").</li>
                        <li class="list-item"><strong>Maintain control of the boat before, during, and after the manoeuvre:</strong> This means executing a deliberate and controlled turn with the tiller, ensuring the boat doesn't lose excessive speed or become unstable. You'll also re-balance the boat immediately on the new tack.</li>
                        <li class="list-item"><strong>Using the tiller extension if normally fitted to your boat type:</strong> You'll learn to hold the tiller extension effectively to allow you to lean out and balance the boat while still steering.</li>
                        <li class="list-item"><strong>Keeping your crew informed of your intentions and progress:</strong> Clear communication is key. You'll call out "Ready about!" or "Tacking!" to your crew and confirm "Tacking!" as the boat turns.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/image4.png" alt="Tacking Diagram showing boat movement">
            </div>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-4">
                <li class="list-item"><strong>Gybing (Through the Wind from Astern):</strong> <strong>Gybing</strong> is a new turn where you turn the back of your boat through the wind, meaning the boom will swing across the boat. You'll learn to <strong>control the smooth swing of the boom carefully</strong>, ensuring it doesn't hit anyone and that the boat remains balanced throughout the turn. It's often harder to control than a tack, especially in stronger winds. When gybing, you'll work on:
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mt-2">
                        <li class="list-item"><strong>Maintaining boat speed through the manoeuvre:</strong> Like tacking, you'll aim to keep the boat moving well. You'll pull the mainsheet in slightly just before the gybe to control the boom's swing, then let it out quickly on the new gybe.</li>
                        <li class="list-item"><strong>Maintaining an awareness of, and avoiding other water users:</strong> Again, a thorough scan before initiating the gybe is crucial. You'll communicate your intentions ("Ready to gybe!" or "Gybing!") to your crew and other vessels.</li>
                        <li class="list-item"><strong>Maintaining control of the boat before, during, and after the manoeuvre:</strong> This involves a steady hand on the tiller to turn the stern through the wind. The key is to manage the boom's swing by actively sheeting the mainsheet. You'll ensure the boat doesn't heel excessively or become unstable.</li>
                        <li class="list-item"><strong>Using the tiller extension if normally fitted to your boat type:</strong> This allows for better body position and control during the turn.</li>
                        <li class="list-item"><strong>Keeping your crew informed of your intentions and progress:</strong> Clear commands like "Ready to gybe!" and "Gybing!" are essential for coordinated action and safety. You'll also warn your crew about the boom's swing.</li>

            <h4 class="sub-section-heading">Points of Sailing</h4>
            <p class="mb-4">You'll be able to <strong>describe the different points of sailing</strong>, understanding your boat's angle in relation to the wind and how to trim your sails accordingly. You'll be able to point to diagrams or other boats and name how they are sailing in relation to the wind.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-4">
                <li class="list-item"><strong>Close-Hauled:</strong> This is the point of sailing where you are sailing as <strong>close to the wind as possible</strong> without your sails luffing (flapping). The boat will be heading approximately 45 degrees into the wind. To achieve this, your sails will be pulled in tightly, and you'll maintain precise steering and balance to keep the boat tracking efficiently "upwind" by zig-zagging (tacking).</li>
                <li class="list-item"><strong>Beam Reach:</strong> When sailing on a <strong>beam reach</strong>, the wind is coming directly across the side of your boat (approximately 90 degrees to your boat's direction). This is often the fastest and most stable point of sailing. You'll learn to trim your sails to a moderate position, letting them out slightly from the close-hauled position to catch the wind effectively, maintaining good speed and control.</li>
                <li class="list-item"><strong>Broad Reach (or Training Run):</strong> On a <strong>broad reach</strong>, the wind is coming from behind your boat, but still slightly to one side (e.g., 120-150 degrees off the bow). A "training run" often refers to a broad reach where the boat is heading almost directly downwind, but not quite. Your sails will be let out further than a beam reach to maximize the wind's drive. This point of sailing requires careful attention to avoid an unintended gybe, especially in stronger winds.</li>
                <li class="list-item"><strong>Run:</strong> A <strong>run</strong> is when you are sailing directly downwind, with the wind coming from directly behind your boat (approximately 180 degrees). To achieve maximum speed and efficiency on a run, you'll let your sails out as wide as possible, often perpendicular to the boat. This point of sailing can be less stable than a reach and demands constant awareness of the wind and careful control of the boom to prevent accidental gybes.</li>

            <h4 class="sub-section-heading">Collision Avoidance (Rules of the Road)</h4>
            <p class="mb-4">Understanding and applying the maritime "Rules of the Road" is paramount to preventing collisions and ensuring safe navigation.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-4">
                <li class="list-item"><strong>Understanding Right of Way:</strong> You'll learn the fundamental "Rules of the Road" for sailors, enabling you to <strong>take the correct action when boats on different tacks meet</strong>. This is crucial for preventing collisions.
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mt-2">
                        <li class="list-item"><strong>Different Tacks:</strong> When two sailboats are approaching each other with the wind coming from different sides (on opposite tacks), the boat with the wind on its <strong>port (left) side</strong> must give way to the boat with the wind on its <strong>starboard (right) side</strong>. You'll practice identifying your own tack and the tack of approaching boats to determine who has right of way and execute the necessary manoeuvre (e.g., altering course or slowing down).</li>
                        <li class="list-item"><strong>Same Tack:</strong> When two boats are on the same tack (wind coming from the same side for both), the <strong>leeward (downwind) boat has right of way</strong>. The windward (upwind) boat must give way. You'll learn to maintain situational awareness, especially when sailing parallel to other boats on the same tack, to ensure you respect the leeward boat's right of way.</li>
                        <li class="list-item"><strong>Other Vessels:</strong> You'll also learn basic rules for interactions with powerboats, commercial vessels, and vessels constrained by their draft, understanding that they generally have less maneuverability than a sailboat and thus often have right of way.</li>

                <li class="list-item"><strong>Tides and Currents:</strong> You'll be able to <strong>describe how tides and currents can affect them</strong>. You'll understand that the water moves in and out (tides) and sometimes flows in rivers or channels (currents), and how this moving water can push your boat around or change how fast you go. You'll learn to:

                        <li class="list-item"><strong>Identify Tidal Patterns:</strong> Recognize rising and falling tides and how they impact water depth, which is vital for safe navigation, especially near shore or in shallow areas.</li>
                        <li class="list-item"><strong>Observe Current Effects:</strong> Spot visual clues of currents (e.g., ripples, objects moving on the water) and understand how a current can increase or decrease your boat's speed over the ground or push you off course. You'll learn to account for current when planning your route or aiming for a specific destination.</li>

                <li class="list-item"><strong>Personal Flotation Devices (PFDs):</strong> You'll be able to <strong>identify when sailors are required to wear PFDs by law</strong>. This includes understanding local regulations and common best practices for when a PFD should be worn, such as when sailing in strong winds, cold water, or when you are a non-swimmer, or simply as a mandatory requirement by the sailing school or club. You'll also learn the importance of ensuring your PFD fits correctly and is in good condition.</li>

                <li class="list-item"><strong>How Often Tides Occur:</strong> You'll be able to <strong>describe how often high and low tides occur</strong>. In most coastal areas, high and low tides occur approximately twice a day. This means you will experience two high tides and two low tides within roughly a 24-hour period. Each change from a high-water mark to a low water mark (or vice-versa) takes approximately 6 hours.</li>
                <li class="list-item"><strong>High Tide:</strong> This is when the water level reaches its highest point. At high tide, there is more water in harbours, over sandbanks, and closer to the shoreline.</li>
                <li class="list-item"><strong>Low Tide:</strong> This is when the water level reaches its lowest point. At low tide, certain areas that were submerged at high tide may become dry, revealing rocks, sandbanks, or exposing mudflats.</li>

                <li class="list-item"><strong>Access to Harbours and Slipways:</strong> Tides significantly affect your ability to launch, recover, and access certain harbours or slipways. At low tide, some areas may become too shallow to allow your boat to float, potentially leading to you getting stuck in mud or on the bottom. You'll learn to check tidal predictions to ensure sufficient water depth for your planned activities.</li>
                <li class="list-item"><strong>Navigating Shallow Areas:</strong> Areas that appear safe to sail through at high tide can become dangerously shallow or even completely dry at low tide. This presents a significant risk of <strong>running aground</strong> (getting stuck on the seabed or a hidden obstacle). You'll learn to consult charts and tidal information to identify such areas and avoid them during low water.</li>
                <li class="list-item"><strong>Tidal Currents:</strong> As the tide moves in and out, it creates <strong>tidal currents</strong> (moving water). These currents can have a substantial impact on your boat's speed and direction over the ground. You'll learn how a strong current can either boost your progress or slow you down, and how it can push your boat off your intended course, requiring you to adjust your steering to stay on track.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-4">Understanding these tidal implications is essential for planning your sailing trips safely, avoiding hazards, and ensuring you can always get to and from your desired locations without incident.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">You'll learn to identify the direction of the wind relative to the land and understand its significant implications for your sailing activity and safety.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-4">
                <li class="list-item"><strong>Onshore Winds:</strong>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mt-2">
                        <li class="list-item"><strong>Description:</strong> Onshore winds are those that blow <strong>towards</strong> the land from the water.</li>
                        <li class="list-item"><strong>Effect on Sailing:</strong> When sailing with an onshore wind, it generally makes it easier to return to shore if you encounter difficulties, as the wind will naturally push your boat in that direction. This can be a comforting factor, particularly for beginners or when exploring new areas.</li>
                        <li class="list-item"><strong>Safety Implication:</strong> Provides a 'safety net' pushing you towards land in case of equipment failure or exhaustion. However, you must still manage your approach to the shore to avoid hazards.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li class="list-item"><strong>Offshore Winds:</strong>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mt-2">
                        <li class="list-item"><strong>Description:</strong> Offshore winds are those that blow <strong>away</strong> from the land towards the open water.</li>
                        <li class="list-item"><strong>Effect on Sailing:</strong> Sailing with an offshore wind means that if you lose control, break down, or become tired, the wind will push you further away from the safety of the land. This makes it significantly harder to sail or return to shore, potentially increasing the danger if you drift.</li>
                        <li class="list-item"><strong>Safety Implication:</strong> Demands greater caution and preparedness. Always ensure your boat is in good working order and that you have a reliable means of propulsion (e.g., oars, small engine) if an offshore wind is present. It's crucial to be mindful of your ability to get back against the wind.</li>

            <h4 class="sub-section-heading">Understanding Wind Strength and Its Impact</h4>
            <p class="mb-4">You'll also learn how the strength of the wind dictates your sailing activity, and the safety measures you need to employ.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-4">
                <li class="list-item"><strong>High Winds:</strong>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mt-2">
                        <li class="list-item"><strong>Description:</strong> High winds refer to strong wind conditions that generate significant power in your sails.</li>
                        <li class="list-item"><strong>Effect on Sailing:</strong> While exhilarating, high winds lead to very fast sailing and can make the boat harder to control. The increased force on the sails can cause excessive heeling (leaning over) and put strain on the boat and rigging.</li>
                        <li class="list-item"><strong>Safety Implication:</strong> In high winds, it's often necessary to <strong>reef your sail</strong> (make it smaller) to reduce its area and thus reduce the power generated. This helps maintain control, reduces stress on the boat, and prevents capsizing. You'll learn the techniques for reefing. Sailing in high winds requires more experience and skill to manage the boat effectively and safely.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li class="list-item"><strong>No Wind (Calm Conditions):</strong>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mt-2">
                        <li class="list-item"><strong>Description:</strong> No wind, or light wind, refers to calm conditions where there is insufficient wind to propel the boat.</li>
                        <li class="list-item"><strong>Effect on Sailing:</strong> This results in a slow, gentle day on the water, or no movement at all. While peaceful, it means your boat has little steerage way (ability to respond to the rudder) and you cannot sail to your desired destination.</li>
                        <li class="list-item"><strong>Safety Implication:</strong> The primary safety concern in no wind is being stranded. You'll learn the importance of having alternative means of propulsion, such as <strong>paddles or oars</strong>, to get back to shore or to a more favourable wind area. While generally minimal risk for capsizing, it can lead to exposure if caught unexpectedly far from shore, emphasizing the need for contingency plans.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="sub-section-heading">General Safety Practices</h4>
            <p class="mb-4">Beyond understanding wind conditions, you'll learn crucial safety habits:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-4">
                <li class="list-item"><strong>Shore Contact and Trip Plans:</strong> You'll understand why it's important to <strong>tell someone ashore</strong> (like family, friends, or a sailing club contact) <strong>where you're going and when you expect to be back</strong>. This is a critical safety practice. If you don't return as expected, someone will know to initiate a search or call for help, providing vital information about your last known location.</li>
                <li class="list-item"><strong>Signalling for Help:</strong> You'll learn different ways to <strong>get help if you or someone else needs it on the water</strong>:
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mt-2">
                        <li class="list-item"><strong>Visual Signals:</strong> Waving your arms slowly and repeatedly, raising and lowering them out to your sides.</li>
                        <li class="list-item"><strong>Audible Signals:</strong> Using a loud whistle (distinct from recreational sounds), or other sound-producing devices.</li>
                        <li class="list-item"><strong>VHF Radio:</strong> If you are on a safety boat or a larger vessel, you'll learn basic radio procedures to make a distress call (e.g., Mayday or Pan-Pan).</strong></li>
                        <li class="list-item"><strong>Other Devices:</strong> Flares (day/night), signal mirrors, or even your mobile phone in areas with coverage (though less dependable on water).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-4">By mastering these aspects of weather awareness and safety procedures, you'll be well-equipped to make informed decisions and ensure a safe and enjoyable sailing experience.</p>
